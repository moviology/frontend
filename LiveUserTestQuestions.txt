How this test will work:

1. You will be shown to your seat
2. We will put sweat monitors on your index and middle finger, as well as a heart rate monitor on your wrist
3. You will be shown a 5–20-minute movie clip, which will range from a horror movie to a comedy
4. While you are watching the movie, we will be monitoring your heart rate and sweat levels
5. After the movie, we will ask you to rate the movie on a scale of 1-10 as well as answer a few questions
