How this test will work:

1. You will be shown to your seat
2. We will put sweat monitors on your index and middle finger, as well as a heart rate monitor on your wrist
3. You will be shown a 5–20-minute movie clip, which will range from a horror movie to a comedy
4. While you are watching the movie, we will be monitoring your heart rate and sweat levels
5. After the movie, we will ask you to rate the movie on a scale of 1-10 as well as answer a few questions


For this test, the “Audience” will be reacting to the “Toy truck return scene” from the 2016 horror movie “The Conjuring 2”. During this test, the “Audience” will watch the scene while having their Heart rate and level of sweat recorded. After this part of the test, the “Audience” will be asked to fill out the following questionnaire so we can see how they feel about the test and the overall experience.

Tester 2

•	What would you rate your experience on a scale of 1 to 10
	4

•	Q1: As a horror movie director, what sort of reaction do you hope to get from the audience?
I would hope that I can clearly see where the audience have a strong reaction to my movie or clips

•	Q2: Did you get the reaction you hoped for?
	I don’t know as I can not really read the graphs that you have given me

•	Q3: Did you find the system easy to use? 
Other than the graphs that I can’t read the rest of the system is easy to use and feels like any other website in my opinion

•	Q4: Did you find the system intuitive?
Sure, the website in pretty intuitive to use but at may just be due to it being pretty similar to other websites 

•	Q5: Was there anything confusing or difficult about the website or flow of the website?
	As I said the graphs were pretty bad but other than it was fine

•	Q6: Would you ever use this website as an aspiring movie director?
I can see why an aspiring director would like a product like this but I once again feel like the graphs might be too hard for some to understand

•	Q7: If not, explain why 
I just feel like the graphs should either be clearer to read or have some other data that is either on the side or can be switched on that gives you the data in more common English

•	Q8: What do you think of the layout of the website?
	I think the overall layout is fine like I have said before the way you get around it feels like 	most other website I use

If you change the graphs around I would be happy to take this test again as I do think this application could really be something

•	Q12: If not, why not?
If the graphs are not changed to be easier to read I personally see no use for it as the major draw of the application is too hard for the average person to understand

•	Q13: What about the test would you want to change?
	I don’t think anything about the test as a whole needs to be changed as it does mirror quite 	well what it would be like to use it for real

•	Q14: After the interview, did the rating of your experience change at all
No not particularly as while I do see where this kind of product could go, I do not think it near where it has the ability to be

Other than just keep at it and I hope this endeavour go wells for all of you, Not really I have said my piece on this app



Final Analysis

When looking at the tests and analysing them it is best to look at them in two sections one for the Audience members and one for the Directors. Starting with the Audience 

Audience Analysis

From what we gathered from the audience members we can see that the issue of the monitors/sensors exists in that they limit what the wearer can do while wearing it which while over a short time frame is not that big of a problem, If the user was to watch a full 90 – 120 minute movie with them on it could get very annoying for them as they can only really use one hand.

It is also clear that some members where not a fan of the fact we used horror movies which was something we had anticipated to happened as there a quite a lot of people that do not enjoy horror movies so in the future we may have other clips used for testing but at the current moment we will stick to horror movies as they tend to give the best result due to the level of tension and fear they give people allowing for good readings.

It was also good to hear that the testers would be willing to do the test again even the tester that was not happy with the movie choice, But it also makes us have to consider what sort of movie we show to people as we seen some people really do not like horror movies and it unfair to show them those kind of movies so it would be better to have different types of clips and ask people what sort of movie they would want to see. Which would be good as it lets us data on different types of movies and not just horror movies.





Director Analysis

When looking at how the directors felt about everything it clear to see that they both liked the layout and flow of the website and said it was quite easy to use which is good as that was something we wanted to make sure we got right as it does not matter how useful the website can be if people are unable to use it.

It was good that they also liked the colour scheme as having to redo the whole colour scheme would take a while to do and would take time that we don’t have time for but we were told that maybe changing the colour brightness might make it a bit easier to look at for long periods of time.

But the one thing we need to work on the most is graphs as while one of the testers was able to read the graphs the other one was not able to and if that is an issue that other users have it could cause massive issues and make people not want to use our system so those will need to be improved

We also found that young or aspiring director would like this kind of system as it would better allow them to see if the movies, they are making the impact they want them too which is very valuable when starting out as a director as it can help you make a name for yourself and allow them to grow




Final Points

From the tests we ran we can that while there are issues that need to be addressed overall the over all feed back was positive which was very good.

So moving forward what we need to focus on is improving the graphs so they are easier for people to understand as well as we need to gain a wider array of movies, clips and scenes to show people so we can gain data on more movie genres as well as appeal to more people as this is a system we want all kinds of directors to use not just horror movie directors.
